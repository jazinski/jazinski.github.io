            Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable web applications 
            and solving complex technical challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in full-stack development with expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks, 
            cloud infrastructure, and distributed systems. My experience spans across developing 
            enterprise-level applications, optimizing system performance, and implementing robust 
            CI/CD pipelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I focus on creating 
            efficient, maintainable code that delivers exceptional user experiences. I'm particularly 
            interested in cloud architecture, microservices, and leveraging cutting-edge technologies 
            to build innovative solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, exploring new 
            technologies, and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
