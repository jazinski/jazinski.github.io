2. **Missing Language Attribute**
   - Add `lang="en"` to `<html>` tag
   - Priority: High - essential for screen readers

3. **Link Accessibility (2 issues)**
   - Ensure links have discernible text
   - Ensure links are distinguished without relying solely on color
   - Priority: High

4. **Landmark Structure (7 issues)**
   - Add `<main>` landmark element
   - Ensure all content is contained within proper ARIA landmarks
   - Priority: Medium - important for screen reader navigation
